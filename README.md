pySCLikeSync
============

A simple soundcloud downloader written in python (2.7).

It does require 2 moduels (install them via `pip install <module>`).

* [Soundcloud](https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-python) e.g. `pip install soundcloud`
* [mutagen](https://bitbucket.org/lazka/mutagen) e.g. `pip install mutagen` (ignored < 1.3)

On linux the `pip` commands might require `sudo` access. It only works with python 2.7 due to the print-print()-changes and the urllib module, which is removed in python 3.X (until it's installed manually). Currently there are no plans to release a port to python 3.4, since python 2.7 is still the commonly preinstalled version on linux os.
